			<h3>What is AnonTwit?</h3>
			<p>
				AnonTwit stands for Anonymous Twitter. It's a place where anyone can anonymously put out short messages, similar to Twitter.<br>
				It's very simple and is in the very early stages of development.<br><br>

				By design, AnonTwit has no user infrastructure, no profiles can be created. This means it is completely anonymous.<br>
				It was made to be used as a way to anonymously express thoughts, feelings, and ideas, becoming some sort of a speech melting pot.<br><br>

				There will eventually be post moderation.<br><br>

			<h3>What is BubbleNet?</h3>
			<p>
				BubbleNet was originally thought of as a place where anyone can anonymously put out short messages, similar to Twitter, but with the anonymity of 4chan.<br><br>

				This was the thought that I ran with for most of the site's development up until recently. Through testing during development, I have found that BubbleNet functions best<br>as a bulletin board for small, enclosed communities, such as a household or a school camp. Hereon, it will be designed primarily for LANs, not for exposure to the outside world.<br><br>

				By design, BubbleNet has no user infrastructure, no profiles can be created. This means it is completely anonymous.<br>
				It was made to be used as a way to anonymously express thoughts, feelings, and ideas, becoming some sort of a speech melting pot.<br><br>

				There will eventually be post moderation. Click the site name at the top of the page to access the feed.<br><br>

# bubblenet webpage
Webpage for BubbleNet. Includes a basic explanation of what the platform is, its purpose, and use, alongside screenshots and a button linking to the latest version.  
  
The webpage has purposefully minimal effort put into it, as I consider the actual software (BubbleNet itself) more important.

# bubblenet
 
BubbleNet (formerly AnonTwit) can be thought of as the baby of 4chan and Twitter.  
It takes ideas from both platforms; the anonymity of 4chan, and the bite-sized, moment-to-moment tweets of Twitter.  
  
BubbleNet is meant to be a bulletin board for small, enclosed communities, such a household or school camp.
  
This platform will hopefully grow to be usable, but is currently in it's most precious stages of infancy.  

## installation
1. First, download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't already have it. This will install the NPM package manager as well.
2. To start up the server, enter ``node server.js`` into the Terminal or ``./start``, also in the project directory. This will start running the server code file, as well as installing any required packages.

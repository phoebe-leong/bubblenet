# anonymous twitter
 
Anonymous Twitter (working title) can be thought of as the baby of 4chan and Twitter.  
It takes ideas from both platforms; the anonymity of 4chan, and the bite-sized, moment-to-moment tweets of Twitter.  
  
Anonymous Twitter is a place where you can put your thoughts out into the world and nobody can track you down or even find anything more about who you are, save the message they found you from.  
  
This platform will hopefully grow to be usable, but is currently in it's most precious stages of infancy.  

## installation
1. First, download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't already have it. This will install the NPM package manager as well.
2. Run ``npm install`` in the project's directory Terminal. This installs all the dependencies that the server needs to run.
3. To start up the server, enter ``node server.js`` into the Terminal, also in the project directory. This will start running the server code file.
